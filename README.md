# Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) is a key performance indicator that measures how satisfied customers are with a company’s products, services, or experiences.
- **Formula**:  
  `CSAT = (Number of Satisfied Customers / Total Responses) × 100`
- **Segmentation**:
  - Typically, uses a 1–5 scale:
    - Satisfied = 4–5
    - Neutral = 3
    - Dissatisfied = 1–2
- **Use Case**: Measures short-term satisfaction with a product/service.
